Rich Dad Poor Dad

INTRODUCTION 


There is a Need 

Does school prepare children for the real world? “Study hard and get good grades and you will 
find a high-paying job with great benefits,” my parents used to say. Their goal in life was to 
provide a college education for my older sister and me, so that we would have the greatest 
chance for success in life. When I finally earned my diploma in 1976-graduating with honors, 
and near the top of my class, in accounting from Florida State University-my parents had 
realized their goal. It was the crowning achievement of their lives. In accordance with the 
“Master Plan,” I was hired by a “Big 8” accounting firm, and I looked forward to a long career 
and retirement at an early age. 

My husband, Michael, followed a similar path. We both came from hardworking families, of 
modest means but with strong work ethics. Michael also graduated with honors, but he did it 
twice: first as an engineer and then from law school. He was quickly recruited by a prestigious 
Washington, D.C., law firm that specialized in patent law, and his future seemed bright, career 
path well-defined and early retirement guaranteed.
