Title: The Adventures of Mr. Chai and Miss Biscuit

Once upon a time in a humble little kitchen, there lived Mr. Chai, a cup of steaming hot tea with a strong personality and a hint of cardamom. He was wise, warm, and dangerously addictive.

Next to him lived Miss Biscuit — elegant, crunchy, and slightly dramatic. Every time someone dipped her in Chai, she would scream, “Not again! I wasn’t ready!” before dissolving into sweet surrender.

One fine morning, Mr. Chai decided to confess his feelings. “Miss Biscuit,” he said in a deep, bold voice, “you complete me — literally, you’re nothing without my warm embrace.”

Miss Biscuit blushed, then cracked slightly (she was a Marie Gold after all). “Oh, Chai,” she said, “you’re such a hot beverage!”

Suddenly, a giant hand appeared! It was the Human. “Nooooo!” shouted Mr. Chai, as Miss Biscuit was dunked once again.

The kitchen fell silent. The love story ended with a crunch.

Moral of the story? Never fall for someone who’ll dip and drop you.
